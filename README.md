### Project Description:
Designed to simplify the creation of meme coins. Allows anyone to quickly and easily launch their own meme token without deep technical knowledge. Users can create a token by uploading an image, choosing a name and symbol, and paying a small fee. The platform uses a bond curve pricing model, where the token price rises as more people buy it, creating liquidity before listing on decentralized exchanges.

- Low-cost token craeation and trading, making it accessible to creators without a large budget
- Tools such as community interaction, price charts, etc. to help users evaluate tokens before investing
- Rewards based on token performance and visibility
- Tools for the platform community to promote tokens
